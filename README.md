# My Data Engineering Portfolio
This repository is all about what I'm learning from the internet (courses, tutorials, and blog posts) about Data Engineering (in the future it will be about the **MLOps** field, which takes Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering, all combined).

But why **Data Engineering**? Because loving **DevOps** culture and **Machine Learning** field is not enough for me, a simple Software Engineer, and because I do like almost everything related to **Data**.


# Important note
In this portfolio/side project/study repository I mainly will use [**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/) which covers everything that you probably will have to deal with to run into your local environment, like: 

 - install Python (version =>3.6);
 - install PIP package manager;
 - install all the dependencies that are required to run properly in your local machine;
 - maybe install [**Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/) (which it comes with several and useful tools for **Data Science**, **Data Analysis**, **Machine Learning**, etc);
 - deal with some ~~annoying~~ setups;
 - other things that I miss to put in here;
 
So, you have two choices: or you just have to import those `.ipynb` from **Jupyter Notebooks** into your local environment, or use **Google Colab** and import these files and run it in the "***Cloud***".
